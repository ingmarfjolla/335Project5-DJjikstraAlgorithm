Im sorry for the late submission on the project.
I hadnt been in new york for a little bit i had 
to visit some of my family to check in.

For the project, learning the algorithm on my own was a 
little bit difficult and I had to do a lot of testing 

I also may have overused pointers in some instances but 
overall this is a good project, i liked it more than the other ones
i feel like it will come in handy for algorithms.
